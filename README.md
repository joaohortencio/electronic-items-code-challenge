###How to run this code

This code requires PHP 7.1^ and composer to manage dependencies.

Clone from git:
`git clone https://github.com/joaohortencio/electronic-items-code-challenge.git`

Enter the folder created and run composer install:
`composer install`

After downloaded all dependencies, you must use php command line to execute the run.php file, as it follows:
`php run.php answers-to-questions-1-2` to get the answers to questions 1 and 2

to check the unit tests, run the command:
`php run.php run-unit-tests`

To change the scenario, the easiest way is to alter the file `/src/scenarios/1.yaml` and repeat both previous commands.
